PLATFORM:  

What is it?
	A peer to peer network application that enables the “user” to ask questions to industry professionals.

	User: Defined to be individual/group with question/inquiry.
	Industry Professionals: Defined to be any specialist or experienced mentor from industry.

Alternatives: 
Mentoring.org: Website providing services related to finding and getting professional mentors
Difference with us: Our app is ask a question to specialist, not finding professional peers

http://www.mentors.ca/askamentor.html: Website allowing you to ask a question, via web form, and receive a response 
  from a peer mentor. Also has links to individual mentoring sites and telephone references for emergency or 
  confidential items.
Question: Is the website efficient/widely used? Can we do better?
Answer: It asks a connector the question, whereby the connector selects a ‘mentor / expert’ to respond.   
  The process thereby follows, that the above site does not ask an expert directly, but upon the connectors discretion. 
  Therefore, such a site can be vastly improved upon. Various email domains are also banned from the service, 
  creating a selectiveness that may not help the end user or force them to find another site.
